\section{The concept of jets}\label{sec:jet-concept}

When studying high-energy collisions one often has to consider
processes where quarks and gluons are produced in the final-state.
%
For $e^+e^-$ collisions, the study of hadronic final-states has been a
major source of information, helping to establish QCD as the
fundamental theory of strong interactions, but also providing a clean
playground for the study of perturbative QCD and the tuning of
Monte-Carlo event generators.
%
At the LHC, the list of processes involving high-energy quarks and/or
gluons in their final state is even longer. First, since we collide
protons, a hard QCD parton can be radiate from the incoming
partons. Then, other particles like W, Z and Higgs bosons can
themselves decay to quarks. And, finally, when searching for new
particles, one often has to consider decay chains involving quarks and
gluons.

However, these high-energy quarks and gluons are not directly observed
in the final state of the collision. First of all, as mentioned in the
previous chapters, they tend to undergo successive branchings at small
angles, producing a series of collimated quarks and gluons. The fact that this parton shower is
collimated traces back to the collinear divergence of QCD.
%
Starting from a parton with high virtuality (of the order of the hard
scale of the process), the parton shower will produce branchings into
further partons of decreasing virtuality, until one reaches a
non-perturbative (hadronisation) scale, typically of order
$\Lambda_\text{QCD}$ or $1$~GeV.
%
At this stage, due to confinement, these quarks and gluons will form
hadrons. Although some analytic approaches to hadronisation exist,
this non-perturbative step often relies on models implemented in Monte
Carlo Event generators.

Overall, the high-energy partons produced by the collision appear in
the final state as a collimated bunch of hadrons that we call {\em
  jets}.
%
Conceptually, {\it jets are collimated flows of hadrons and they can
  be seen as proxies to the high-energy quarks and gluons produced in
  a collision}.
%
This behaviour is observed directly in experiments where the hadronic
final state appears to be collimated around a few directions in the
detector.


\subsection{Jet definitions and algorithms}\label{sec:jet-algs}

The above picture is over-simplified in a few respects.
%
First of all, partons are ill-defined objects, \eg due to
higher-order QCD corrections where additional partons, real or
virtual, have to be included.
%
Then, whether two particles are part of the same jet or belong to two
separate jets also has some degree of arbitrariness, related to what
we practically mean by ``collimated''. 

The simple concept of what a jet is meant to represent is therefore
not sufficient to practically identify the jets in an event.
%
To do that, one relies on a {\em jet definition}, \ie a well-defined
procedure that tells how to reconstruct the jets from the set of
hadrons in the final state of the collision.

A jet definition can be seen as made of a few essential building
blocks: the {\em jet algorithm}, which is the recipe itself and a set
of parameters associated with free knobs in the algorithm. A typical
parameter, present in almost all jet definitions used in hadron
colliders is the {\em jet radius} which essentially provides a
distance in the rapidity-azimuth ($y-\phi$) plane above which two
particles are considered as no longer part of the same jet, \ie no
longer considered as collinear.

In addition, a jet definition uses a {\em recombination scheme} which
specifies how the kinematic properties of the jet are obtained from
its constituents.
%
Most applications today use the {\em ``$E$-scheme''} recombination
scheme which simply sums the components of the four-vectors. Other
recombination schemes, like the massless $p_t$ or $E_t$ schemes, have
been used in the past but are not discussed here.
%
Several jet-substructure applications make use of the {\em
  winner-take-all} (WTA) recombination scheme \cite{Larkoski:2014uqa}
where the result of the recombination of two particles has the
rapidity, azimuth and mass of the particle with the larger $p_t$, and
a $p_t$ equal to the sum of the two $p_t$'s. As we will further
discuss later in this book, this approach has the advantage that
it reduces effects related to the recoil of the jet axis when
computing jet observables that share similarities with the event-shape broadening~\cite{Rakow:1981qn}.

Over the past few decades, a number of jet algorithms have been
proposed. They typically fall under two big categories: {\em cone
  algorithms} and {\em sequential-recombination algorithms}. We
discuss them both separately below, focusing on the algorithms that
have been most commonly used recently at hadronic colliders.
%
For an extensive review on jet definitions, we highly recommend the
reading of Ref.~\cite{Salam:2009jx}.

\subsection{Basic requirements}\label{sec:jetalgs-snowmass}

Before giving explicit descriptions of how the most commonly-used jet
algorithms are defined, we briefly discuss what basic properties we do
expect them to satisfy.
%
In the 1990s a group of theorists and Tevatron experimentalists
formulated what is known as the Snowmass accord~\cite{Huth:1990mi}. This document
listed the fundamental criteria that any jet algorithm should
satisfy.

\vspace*{0.3cm}\noindent\centerline{\fbox{
\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
%\sf 
Several important properties that should be met by a jet definition are:
\vspace*{-0.2cm}
\begin{enumerate}
  \itemsep-0.1cm
\item Simple to implement in an experimental analysis;
\item Simple to implement in the theoretical calculation;
\item Defined at any order of perturbation theory;
\item Yields finite cross sections at any order of perturbation theory;
\item Yields a cross section that is relatively insensitive to hadronisation.
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}
}}\vspace*{0.3cm}

The first two criteria are mostly practical aspects. For example, if
an algorithm is too slow at reconstructing jets in an experimental
context, it would be deemed impractical. These two conditions also
mean that the algorithm should be applicable to an input made either
of partons (in a theoretical calculation), or of tracks and
calorimeter towers (in an experiment analysis).
%
The third and fourth conditions are mainly those of
IRC safety, a requirement that, as we have already seen, is at the core of
perturbative QCD calculations.
%
The fifth condition is a little bit more subjective.  We have already
seen that the description of a particle-collision event relies upon
several building blocks: the short-distance interaction computed in
fixed-order perturbation theory, the parton shower, the hadronisation
process and multi-parton interactions.
%
Since jets are supposed to capture the ``hard partons in an event'',
one should hope that the jets which come out of each of these
different steps of an event simulation are in good agreement. In
particular, this means that observables built from jet quantities
should be as little sensitive as possible to non-perturbative effects
like hadronisation and the Underlying Event.
%
Furthermore, to be simple to implement in an experimental analysis,
the jets should also be as little sensitive as possible to detector
effects and pileup.

The question of the sensitivity of different jet definitions to
non-perturbative effects, pileup and detector effects has been an
active topic of discussion when deciding which algorithm to use at
Tevatron and the LHC. A complete assessment of this question is
clearly beyond the scope of the present lecture notes. We will however
come back to a few crucial points when introducing the different
relevant jet definitions below.


\section{Sequential recombination algorithms}\label{sec:jetalgs-recombination}

Sequential recombination algorithms are based on the concept that,
from a perturbative QCD viewpoint, jets are the product of successive
parton branchings. These algorithms therefore try to invert this
process by successively recombining two particles into one. This
recombination is based on a distance measure that is small when the
QCD branching process is kinematically enhanced. Thus, one
successively recombine particles which minimise the distance in order
to mimic the QCD dynamics of the parton shower.
%
It is easy to check that all the recombination algorithms described
below are infrared-and-collinear safe.

\paragraph{Generalised-$k_t$ algorithm.}
%
Most of the recombination algorithms used in the context of hadronic
collisions belong to the family of the {\em generalised-$k_t$
  algorithm}~\cite{Cacciari:2011ma} which clusters jets as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take the particles in the event as our initial list of objects.
\item From the list of objects, build two sets of distances: an
  {\em inter-particle distance}
  \begin{equation}
    d_{ij} = \text{min}(p_{t,i}^{2p},p_{t,j}^{2p})\Delta R_{ij}^2,
  \end{equation}
  where $p$ is a free parameter and $\Delta R_{ij}$ is the geometric
  distance in the rapidity-azimuthal angle plane
  (Eq.~(\ref{eq:DeltaR-def}), and a {\em beam distance}
  \begin{equation}
    d_{iB} = p_{t,i}^{2p}R^2,
  \end{equation}
  with $R$ a free parameter usually called the {\em jet radius}.
\item Iteratively find the smallest distance among all the
  $d_{ij}$ and $d_{iB}$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If the smallest distance is a $d_{ij}$ then objects $i$ and
    $j$ are removed from the list and recombined into a new object $k$
    (using the recombination scheme) which is itself added to the
    list.
  \item If the smallest is a $d_{iB}$, object $i$ is called a {\em
      jet} and removed from the list.
  \end{itemize}
  Go back to step 2 until all the objects in the list have
  been exhausted.
\end{enumerate}

In all cases, we see that if two objects are close in the
rapidity-azimuth plane, as would be the case after a collinear parton
splitting, the distance $d_{ij}$ becomes small and the two objects are
more likely to recombine. Similarly, when the inter-particle distances
are such that $\Delta R_{ij}>R$, the beam distance becomes smaller
than the inter-particle distance and objects are no longer recombined,
making $R$ a typical measure of the size of the jet.

\paragraph{$k_t$ algorithm.}
%
Historically, the best-known algorithm in the generalised-$k_t$ family
is the {\em $k_t$ algorithm}~\cite{Catani:1993hr,Ellis:1993tq},
corresponding to $p=1$ above. In that case, a soft emission, \ie one
with small $p_t$, would also be associated a small distance and
therefore recombine early in the clustering process. This is
motivated by the fact that soft emissions are also enhanced in
perturbative QCD.\footnote{Note that the presence of the ``min'' in
  the distance measure, instead of a product, guarantees that two soft
  objects far apart are not recombined. This would lead to undesired
  behaviours and complex analytic structures, as it is the case with
  the JADE algorithm~\cite{Bartel:1986ua,Bethke:1988zc}.}
%
Its sensitivity to soft emissions, while desirable from a perturbative
QCD standpoint, has the disadvantage that jets become more sensitive
to extra soft radiation in the event, typically like the Underlying
Event or pileup.
%
Although the Tevatron experiments have sometimes resorted to the $k_t$
algorithm, they have predominantly used cone algorithms (see below)
for that reason.

\paragraph{Cambridge/Aachen algorithm.}
Another specific cases of the generalised-$k_t$ algorithm is the {\em
  Cambridge/Aachen algorithm}~\cite{Dokshitzer:1997in,Wobisch:1998wt},
obtained by setting $p=0$ above.
%
In this case, the distance becomes purely geometrical and suffers less
from the contamination due to soft backgrounds than the $k_t$
algorithm does.

\paragraph{Anti-$k_t$ algorithm.}
In the context of LHC physics, jets are almost always reconstructed
with the {\em anti-$k_t$ algorithm}~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp}, which
corresponds to the generalised-$k_t$ algorithm with $p=-1$. The
primary advantage of this choice is that it favours hard particles
which will cluster first.
%
A hard jet will grow by successively aggregating soft particles around
it until it has reached a (geometrical) distance $R$ away from the jet
axis. This means that hard jets will be insensitive to soft radiation
and have a circular shape in the $y-\phi$ plane.
% 
This soft-resilience of the anti-$k_t$ algorithm largely
facilitates its calibration in an experimental context and is the main
reason why it was adopted as the default jet clustering algorithm by
all the LHC experiments.

To make things more concrete, we show in
Fig.~\ref{fig:jet-clustering-steps} a step-by-step example of a
clustering sequence with the anti-$k_t$ jet algorithm on a small set
of particles.
%
The successive pairwise recombinations, and beam recombination
giving the final jets, is clearly visible on this figure.
%
Finally, the resilience of anti-$k_t$ jets with respect to soft radiation is shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:jet-areas}, where we see that anti-$k_t$ jets have a
circular shape while Cambridge/Aachen jets have complex
boundaries.\footnote{In practice, the jet areas are obtained by adding
  a infinitely soft particles, {\em aka} ghosts, to each calorimeter
  tower, These are clustered with the hard jets, indicating the
  boundaries of the jets.}

\paragraph{Relevance for jet substructure.}
%
In the context of jet substructure studies, several recombination
algorithms are used. Initially, jets are usually reconstructed using
the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with a large radius (typically $R$ in the
0.8--1.2 range). Many substructure tools then rely on reclustering the
constituents of that jet with another sequential-recombination jet
algorithm (or jet definition), allowing one to have a convenient view
of the jet clustering as a tree structure.
%
The most commonly used algorithm is probably Cambridge/Aachen since it
gives a natural handle on the structure of the jet at different
angular scales, in a way that respects the angular ordering of parton
showers (see.\ also~\cite{Dreyer:2018nbf}).
%
One also relies on the $k_t$ algorithm used \eg to split the jet into
subjets, or the generalised-$k_t$ algorithm with $p=1/2$, used because
it mimics an mass/virtuality ordering of the subjets.
%
More details will be given later when we review the main substructure
tools.

\section{Cone algorithms}\label{sec:jetalgs-cone}

Cone algorithms were first introduced in
1979~\cite{Sterman:1977wj}. They are based on the
idea that jets represent dominant flows of energy in an event.
%
Modern cone algorithms rely on the concept of a {\em
  stable cone}: for a given cone centre $y_c,\phi_c$ in the
rapidity-azimuth plane, one sums the 4-momenta of all the particles
with rapidity and $\phi$ within a (fixed) radius $R$ around the cone
centre; if the 4-momentum of the sum has rapidity $y_c$ and
azimuth $\phi_c$ --- \ie the sum of all the momenta in the cone points
in the direction of the centre of the cone --- the cone is called {\em
  stable}.
%
This can be viewed as a self-consistency criterion.

In order to find stable cones, the JetClu~\cite{Abe:1991ui} and
(various) midpoint-type~\cite{Blazey:2000qt,Abazov:2011vi} cone
algorithms use a procedure that starts with a given set of
seeds. Taking each of them as a candidate cone centre, one calculates
the cone contents, find a new centre based on the 4-vector sum of the
cone contents and iterate until a stable cone is found.
%
The JetClu algorithm, used during Run I at the Tevatron, takes the set
of particles as seeds, optionally above a given $p_t$ cut. This can be
shown to lead to an infrared unsafety when two hard particles are
within a distance $2R$, rendering JetClu unsatisfactory for theoretical
calculations.

Midpoint-type algorithms, used for Run II of the Tevatron, added to
the list of seeds the midpoints between any pair of stable cones found
by JetClu. This is still infrared unsafe, this time when 3 hard
particles are in the same vicinity, \ie one order later in the
perturbative expansion than the JetClu algorithm.
%
This infrared-unsafety issue was solved by the introduction of the
SISCone~\cite{Salam:2007xv} algorithm. It provably finds all possible
stable cones in an event, making the stable cone search
infrared-and-collinear safe.

Finally,  note that finding the stable cones is
not equivalent to finding the jets since stable cones can overlap.
%
The most common approach is to run a split--merge procedure once the
stable cones have been found. This iteratively takes the most
overlapping stable cones and either merges them of splits them depending
on their overlapping fraction.

\section{Implementation}\label{sec:jetdefs-implementation}
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.53\textwidth]{figures/fastjet-timings.pdf}
  \hspace*{0.4cm}
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.38\textwidth}
    \caption{Average clustering time as a function of the event
      multiplicity $N$, obtained with the FastJet implementation of
      several representative algorithms.}\label{fig:fastjet-timings}
    \vspace*{1.4cm}
  \end{minipage}  
\end{figure}


Most of the practical applications of jets use numerical inputs,
either from (fixed-order or parton-shower) Monte Carlo simulations, or
directly from experimental data. It is therefore important to have a
numerical implementation of the jet algorithms.
%
Furthermore, this implementation needs to be fast enough for practical
usability in an experimental (and, to a lesser extent, theoretical)
context.
%
Currently, the standard package for jet clustering is
{\tt{FastJet}}~\cite{Cacciari:2005hq,Cacciari:2011ma},\footnote{See
  also \url{http://fastjet.fr}.} used by both the experimental and
theoretical communities at the LHC. It provides a native
implementation of all the recombination algorithms introduced in
Sec.~\ref{sec:jetalgs-recombination} and plugins for a series of
other jet algorithms, including the cone algorithms discussed in
Sec.~\ref{sec:jetalgs-cone}.
%
As an illustration, we show in Fig.~\ref{fig:fastjet-timings} the
average time it takes to cluster an event with $N$ particles for a few
representative algorithms.
%
For the specific case of the $k_t$ algorithm, we show the timings for
two different implementations: the initial {\tt{ktjet}}
implementation~\cite{Butterworth:2002xg} available at the time of the
Tevatron and deemed too slow, and the {\tt{FastJet}} implementation
which is faster by 2-3 orders of magnitude in the region relevant for
phenomenology (around a few thousands particles).
%
Regarding cone algorithms, this plot shows that
infrared-and-collinear SISCone has clustering times similar to the
unsafe MidPoint.\footnote{MidPoint has here been used with a seed
  threshold of 1~GeV. Without a seed threshold, it would be slower by
  about an order of magnitude.}
%
Finally, if one keeps in mind that in practical (trigger-level) jet
reconstruction at the LHC, one has a few tens of milliseconds for
clustering, Fig.~\ref{fig:fastjet-timings} shows that the
recombination algorithms (and their {\tt{FastJet}} implementation) are
currently clearly preferred.
