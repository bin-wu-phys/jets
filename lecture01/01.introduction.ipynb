    "**Jets** are collimated sprays of hadrons. A jet is typically initiated by a high $p_T$ parton (quark or gluon), produced in some hard process. It, then, radiates and produces a collimated parton shower. Eventually, it hadronizes, turning into the hadrons observed in the detector. In this sense, QCD jets are as close as we can get to experimentally see quarks and gluons.\n",
